* Hi, I'm qucchia

I'm a Christian programmer, bookworm and chess enthusiast, free software supporter and fueled by tea. I use Emacs on a daily basis and find programming fascinating.

* What I'm Working On

Currently, my main project is crafting my desktop configuration using Emacs and EXWM, at my [[https://github.com/qucchia/dotfiles][dotfiles repository]]. It's an opportunity to learn Emacs Lisp and more!

* Where you can find me

You can find me:
